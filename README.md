## About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student at **Queen's University Belfast** (on track for First Class Honours) who loves building things that actually work... most of the time.

When I'm not wrestling with TypeScript types or convincing LLMs to stop hallucinating, you'll find me getting choked out at BJJ practice or managing my over-engineered home server setup that definitely doesn't need that much RAM.

- Currently building: **An AI fitness coach that runs entirely on your phone** (no cloud, no excuses)
- Day job: **IT Technician @ QUB** – I fix computers and occasionally 3D print replacement parts because why not
- Research background: **Belief Propagation algorithms** – as fun as it sounds
- Off-hours: Strategy gaming, BJJ, and adding more drives to my home lab
- Fuel: Questionable amounts of coffee

## Featured Projects

### Edge-AI Fitness Tracker | *"IronLogic"*
> Teaching a 3B parameter LLM to be your gym bro – entirely offline

My proudest creation. A React Native fitness app with an on-device AI coach powered by Llama 3.2 via Executorch. No internet? No problem.

**Highlights:**
- Custom **TOON protocol** for token-optimized communication (because context windows aren't cheap)
- Deterministic repair pipeline to stop the AI from making up exercises that don't exist
- SQLite relational database (migrated from the "just save it as JSON" era)
- Full Jest test suite because I've been hurt before

### Library Management System
> OOP done right (according to my professor)

A Java-based inventory system for borrowing, returning, and searching books. Includes extensive black-box testing because I don't trust my own code.

### Inventory Data Manager
> CRUD operations, but make it aesthetic

A C# desktop application with a GUI frontend and normalized SQL backend. Perfect for when you need to extract, store, and manipulate data without losing your sanity.

`C#` `.NET` `SQL` `Windows Forms`

|------|--------------|------|
| IT Technician | Queen's University Belfast | Aug 2024 – Present |
| Summer Research Intern | Queen's University Belfast | Jun 2023 – Aug 2023 |

**Fun facts from work:**
- Rolled out Windows 11 to more labs than I can count
- 3D printed custom hardware parts to save equipment from the e-waste bin
- Researched Belief Propagation algorithms and somehow didn't lose my mind

## What I'm Looking For

I'm hunting for a **technical role** where I can:
- Build cool stuff with modern tech stacks
- Solve problems that actually matter
- Work with people who know that "it works on my machine" isn't a valid deployment strategy
